## CO2 Coupons: A proposal for organizing CO2 reduction

If you want to send improvements, I am happy to accept your
GitHub pull request (PR) using Markdown notation.

**If you have never used git or GitHub**, there will be an awful lot 
to learn, but you can then participate in tens of thousands of 
projects that use these as essential tools.
Start learning at [https://help.github.com/en/github](GitHub help)
(web search will find you _plenty_ of additional advice,
like this 
[https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](GitHub Getting Started document)).
You only need a few of the steps:
- create a GitHub account
- fork this repository
- in your fork, create a branch
- make your change in your branch, using the GitHub editor
  (preferably all in one go)
- create a pull request for the branch.

But please _keep your pull request small_ and constrain it to these types:
- corrections of typos and punctuation mistakes
- better individual terms or words (in particular in the French version,
  please explain in German or English)
- simplification of individual sentences to make the text
  easier to understand.

I will _not_ react to proposals to change the content (meaning)
of the text; this would overwhelm my capacity, sorry.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The proposal text is in the public domain.

The theme used on the website is based on the 
[Jekyll Minima theme](https://github.com/jekyll/minima).

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/prechelt/co2-minus/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/prechelt/co2-minus/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

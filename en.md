# Let's unjam climate politics!

## Summary

What we _should_ do to solve the climate crisis:

- Determine an overall CO2 budget that decreases year-by-year,
- give every citizen their part of it as a voucher,
- require companies that market oil, natural gas, or coal
  to buy such vouchers for it.

Not much more than this is needed.

What in fact we _are doing_, however,
is so horribly complicated
that nobody understands it properly,
there is a lot of political conflict around it,
and so the people are not convinced of the proposals.  
That is a bad idea and we should stop it.

## <a name="proposal"></a>Solution proposal: CO2 vouchers

- (C1) We **decide how quickly CO2 emissions should be reduced** 
  down to zero. 
  Let's say we pick 30 years.
  Then the permitted CO2 **emissions decrease annually**
  by one-thirtieth (3.3%) of today's value.
- (C2) **Everyone** will continue to have **the same right** to produce 
  CO2 emissions as any other person (young or old). 
  This results in the same expected personal CO2 emission 
  for each citizen for one year.
- (C3) Then every citizen has this situation:
  At the beginning of each year, **I receive a voucher**
  for that expected personal CO2 emission.  
  Anyone who wants to produce or import **fossil energy** or fuels
  (crude oil, natural gas, or coal) 
  **must buy vouchers from me or somebody else** correspondingly.
  That is the only way in which vouchers are used.
  So I will typically sell my voucher to a company.
  I do not need the voucher to buy e.g. electricity or fuel,
  but the company needs it that produces (or imports) oil or coal.
  It must show a corresponding amount of vouchers to the government
  and can only get them from citizens.
- (C4) Everything else is driven by prices:
  Any product requiring CO2 emissions will become a little more expensive
  (more if more CO2 is "in it"), but the price increase is only due
  to the voucher price.  
  So if I consume just as much CO2 as the average person,
  the price increases will amount to just the amount I got when
  selling my voucher.
  If I consume less CO2 than the average person,
  I will keep some of my voucher money.
  Only if I consume more than average,
  it will cost more than my voucher was worth.

Sounds reasonable?

**Then let's call our politicians to put this into effect!**


## <a name="yes-but"></a>Objections: Yes, but...


### Yes, but will all EU countries join this scheme?

Yes, they almost do so already.

About half of the EU's CO2 emissions are already covered
by the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) today.
ETS requires polluters to buy CO2 "certificates" (some of them
are given away, not sold).
The biggest difference to CO2 vouchers is that certificate proceeds
are kept by the governments.
The other half of the emissions are planned to be included in ETS
in later years.

If the people call for a switch to CO2 vouchers, 
the EU can do that readily.


### Yes, but my job strongly depends on CO2!

That is true for a few branches such as steel, aluminium, cement, or coal.
If the product is difficult to replace (such as steel, aluminium, or cement),
it will become more expensive, but most jobs will continue to exist.

For cases where a lot of jobs are indeed threatened,
politics has several years time to find a socially acceptable solution.


### Yes, but then can we still compete with other countries?

Yes, we can.

1. A large part of imports and exports happens _within_ the EU.
EU countries will follow the same rules (EU single market) and 
the competitive situation will not change at all.

2. For imports from and exports to _outside_ the EU,
the price difference for most products is too small to matter.

3. And where it does:
- _Imports_ from outside the EU can be CO2-tariffed
  (which is allowed by the GATT rules' article III).
- _Exports_ to outside the EU can be put on par via a CO2 credit.

Over time, more and more countries are likely to pick up the
CO2 voucher system themselves and the problem will vanish.

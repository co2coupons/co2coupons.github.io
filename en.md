## <a name="today"></a>Current situation

- (A1) For a long time, the average temperature has been rising worldwide
  because the atmosphere's CO2 content is rising.
  If the temperature increase is not stopped, there will be 
  serious consequences for humanity.
- (A2) Therefore, annual fossil CO2 emissions have to be reduced 
  to zero rapidly.
- (A3) There is broad agreement about this, but a political decision that
  will reliably manage to do this is not in sight.
- (A4) The problem is that most political actors want to link the rules on 
  CO2 reduction with other policies, but there is 
  too little agreement about those.

Therefore, we should regulate only CO2 reduction at first, 
because that is urgent.
Everything else should be tackled only then. 
This requires a CO2 reduction proposal that makes sense to a large majority.

Here is such a proposal for the European Union (EU).


## <a name="proposal"></a>Solution proposal: CO2 vouchers

- (B1) We decide how quickly CO2 emissions should be reduced to effectively
  zero. 
  Let's say we start in 2022 and end in 2051, a period of 30 years.
- (B2) During this period, the permitted CO2 emissions decrease annually 
  by one-thirtieth (3.3%) of the 2021 value.
- (B3) Everyone will continue to have the same right to produce 
  CO2 emissions as any other person (young or old). 
  This results in the same personal CO2 allowance for each person for one year.
- (B4) At the beginning of each year, every person receives a voucher 
  for that CO2 allowance.
  The voucher is valid for 2 years and then expires if it is not used. 
  The voucher can be sold, but only once.
- (B5) Anyone who wants to produce or import fossil energy or fuels
  (crude oil, natural gas, or coal) 
  must buy vouchers correspondingly.
- (B6) When the voucher system has been in operation for four years,
  we will regulate how it is possible to create additional vouchers through 
  negative CO2 emissions, i.e., 
  the permanent removal of CO2 from the atmosphere.
  After that, we will also regulate how other greenhouse gases 
  (such as methane and nitrous oxide) are included into the reduction mechanism.

That's all.


## <a name="consequences"></a>Likely consequences

The solution is fair, simple, and understandable. 
**It will appear obvious to many people and can 
therefore receive strong support.**

Here are the main effects we should expect:

- (C1) Everything that involves CO2 emissions will become more expensive
  because someone has to buy vouchers for it (directly or indirectly).
- (C2) This price increase is compensated by an equally large increase in
  purchasing power, because the proceeds from selling the vouchers wind up
  in the consumer's hands.
- (C3) Anyone who has below-average personal CO2 emissions 
  will even be left with more money than before.
- (C4) Due to the gradual decline in total CO2 emissions, the economic effects
  also arrive gradually.
  We have time to prepare and adapt to them. 
  Politicians have time to discuss measures against any adverse effects.
- (C5) The effects happen everywhere where direct or indirect CO2 emissions
  are caused, via price formation in the market economy, realizing the
  polluter-pays principle.
  Nobody needs to know all those effects beforehand. 
  The pricing of CO2 adapts automatically to achieve the reduction required
  along the whole time period.
- (C6) By pricing CO2 directly at source, there are no loopholes.
- (C7) Due to the limited 2-year validity of the vouchers and their sale
  being allowed only once, financial speculation with vouchers (which would
  complicate the economic adapation process) is hardly possible.
- (C8) However, unless the voucher system is launched globally at the same time,
  it will provide competitive advantage to players outside the EU.
  - For _imports_ into the EU, this can be offset by tariffs based on 
    estimated CO2 emissions. 
    Existing free trade agreements must be adjusted accordingly.
  - For _exports_ from the EU, compensation would require subsidies, 
    which would be unrealistic and would undermine the purpose.
    The problem is not quite as big as it sounds:
    In absolute terms, the EU is the second largest exporter in the world, 
    but as a share of GDP, the export rate is less than half of the 
    world average, 
    because due to the EU's enormous size, most trade happens within the EU.
    Nevertheless, this issue is the biggest obstacle for the idea.
- (C9) Some products become much more expensive, for example, steel and cement.
  The economic situation of their producers becomes more difficult. 
  At the same time, the economic conditions for alternative products improve
  and great new investment opportunities emerge.
  This is particularly pronounced for electricity 
  (green electricity becomes more competitive compared to fossil power)
  and for cars (new types of engines become more competitive compared to 
  gasoline and diesel engines).
- (C10) In addition, many services get cheaper relative to industrial products
  because services require little fossil energy. 
  This creates new jobs because many services are much more labor-intensive 
  than industrial products.
- (C11) Overall, the proposal creates economic growth because 
  new market opportunities are created and economic actors can see
  into the future far enough to take the investment risks involved.
- (C12) In the medium term, this economic momentum will also let
  interest rates increase.
  Saving or buying EU stocks will become more worthwhile than it is today.

**Further disadvantages:**

- (D1) Implementing the proposal is not too simple.
  The following must be managed:
  - Issuing vouchers to all citizens.
  - Enabling trading coupons through an easily accessible exchange.
  - Reliably monitoring the production and import of CO2 carriers 
    oil, natural gas, and coal.

**Further advantages:**

- (E1) Details of the adaptation are left to the self-organization of society
  and need not be politically negotiated under great uncertainty beforehand. 
  As a result, the solution can quickly be put into effect for the 
  entire period of CO2 reduction.
- (E2) Politics can again focus on what it is good at: 
  _responding_ to changes in order to mitigate undesirable consequences
  and promote desired ones.
- (E3) Anyone who thinks the reduction is too slow can let vouchers expire.
- (E4) Lots of current environmental law will become superfluous and
  can be done away with.


# <a name="successchances"></a>Chances of success

Does the proposal have a prospect of success? 
There are probably only two major obstacles within the EU: 
the EU-internal production of fossil fuels and the competitiveness of exports.
Are they solvable? 
That's hard to say. 
Some considerations:

- (F1) The EU produces about 20% of its oil itself, 
  about 40% of its natural gas, and most of its coal.
  ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy_of_the_European_Union#Energy_sources),
  [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_European_countries_by_coal_production)).
  These industries have a lot of political power, 
  but the number of jobs affected is not huge -- largest for coal.
- (F2) The EU is the biggest trading partner for no fewer than 80 of
  the world's countries
  ([source](https://ec.europa.eu/trade/policy/eu-position-in-world-trade/)),
  so it has a strong negotiating position.
  The main export destinations of the EU are the USA, Britain (soon) 
  and China. 
  Like the EU, the US and China are very large and therefore have 
  a much lower-than-average export quota (as a percentage of GDP), 
  so that the same solution with CO2 vouchers could also be acceptable for them.
  The UK might adopt it because it will remain closely linked to the EU. 
  What are the prospects for an introduction in these countries?
  - With the US, an agreement currently appears unlikely.
  - For Britain, who can say today?
  - But China is already pursuing a vigorous CO2-saving policy and is 
    rapidly expanding solar energy, wind energy, 
    as well as energy saving and air pollution regulations
    ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_policy_of_China)).
- (F3) Both of these problems are big and difficult to solve.
  But then, the EU is the world's largest trading bloc.
  If anyone can solve the export problem, then it is the EU.
  Also, the EU is the world's largest "consensus machine". 
  Its ability to understand its shared interests and use them to
  balance its conflicting interests is unrivaled anywhere in the world.

**Let's have confidence!**

# Let's unjam climate politics!

## Summary

What we _should_ do to solve the climate crisis:

- Determine an overall CO2 budget that decreases year-by-year,
- give every citizen their part of it as a voucher,
- require companies that market oil, natural gas, or coal
  to buy such vouchers for it.

Not much more than this is needed.

What in fact we _are doing_, however,
is so horribly complicated
that nobody understands it properly,
there is a lot of political conflict around it,
and so the people are not convinced of the proposals.  
That is a bad idea and we should stop it.

## <a name="proposal"></a>Solution proposal: CO2 vouchers

- (C1) We **decide how quickly CO2 emissions should be reduced** 
  down to zero. 
  Let's say we pick 30 years.
  Then the permitted CO2 **emissions decrease annually**
  by one-thirtieth (3.3%) of today's value.
- (C2) **Everyone** will continue to have **the same right** to produce 
  CO2 emissions as any other person (young or old). 
  This results in the same expected personal CO2 emission 
  for each citizen for one year.
- (C3) Then every citizen has this situation:
  At the beginning of each year, **I receive a voucher**
  for that expected personal CO2 emission.  
  Anyone who wants to produce or import **fossil energy** or fuels
  (crude oil, natural gas, or coal) 
  **must buy vouchers from me or somebody else** correspondingly.
  That is the only way in which vouchers are used.
  So I will typically sell my voucher to a company.
  I do not need the voucher to buy e.g. electricity or fuel,
  but the company needs it that produces (or imports) oil or coal.
  It must show a corresponding amount of vouchers to the government
  and can only get them from citizens.
- (C4) Everything else is driven by prices:
  Any product requiring CO2 emissions will become a little more expensive
  (more if more CO2 is "in it"), but the price increase is only due
  to the voucher price.  
  So if I consume just as much CO2 as the average person,
  the price increases will amount to just the amount I got when
  selling my voucher.
  If I consume less CO2 than the average person,
  I will keep some of my voucher money.
  Only if I consume more than average,
  it will cost more than my voucher was worth.

Sounds reasonable?

**Then let's call our politicians to put this into effect!**


## <a name="yes-but"></a>Objections: Yes, but...


### Yes, but will all EU countries join this scheme?

Yes, they almost do so already.

About half of the EU's CO2 emissions are already covered
by the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) today.
ETS requires polluters to buy CO2 "certificates" (some of them
are given away, not sold).
The biggest difference to CO2 vouchers is that certificate proceeds
are kept by the governments.
The other half of the emissions are planned to be included in ETS
in later years.

If the people call for a switch to CO2 vouchers, 
the EU can do that readily.


### Yes, but my job strongly depends on CO2!

That is true for a few branches such as steel, aluminium, cement, or coal.
If the product is difficult to replace (such as steel, aluminium, or cement),
it will become more expensive, but most jobs will continue to exist.

For cases where a lot of jobs are indeed threatened,
politics has several years time to find a socially acceptable solution.


### Yes, but then can we still compete with other countries?

Yes, we can.

1. A large part of imports and exports happens _within_ the EU.
EU countries will follow the same rules (EU single market) and 
the competitive situation will not change at all.

2. For imports from and exports to _outside_ the EU,
the price difference for most products is too small to matter.

3. And where it does:
- _Imports_ from outside the EU can be CO2-tariffed
  (which is allowed by the GATT rules' article III).
- _Exports_ to outside the EU can be put on par via a CO2 credit.

Over time, more and more countries are likely to pick up the
CO2 voucher system themselves and the problem will vanish.


## <a name="but"></a>Fundamental doubts: But...

### But is the current climate change man-made at all?

We know fairly well how much coal, mineral oil, and natural gas we burn
and how much CO2 is emitted as a result.
The rise of CO2 concentration in the atmosphere matches these amounts well.
The fact that CO2 is a greenhouse gas can be measured in the laboratory.
We also have countless atmospheric measurements made by satellites
and weather balloons.

From all this, we can compute the expected amount of global warming.
If we do not let short-term variations (such as the very warm year 1998)
distract us, this expectation matches measured values well
There is no doubt that the current global warming exists and is man-made.

Global warming, however, is not the same as climate change.
Climate change (which is happening continually since millions of years)
is a still much more complex phenomenon with
very many factors influencing it.
So whether to call the current climate change man-made or not
is to some degree a matter of taste.

But there is no doubt that the current global warming is a main driver
of the current climate change and that this climate change
has dire consequences for humankind.

### But aren't natural climate variations much larger?

Indeed there was a time when global temperature was 12 degrees higher
than it is today -- and that was definitely not man-made.  
So are 2 or 3 degrees more than today a problem at all?  
And does human activity make much of a difference?

Well, those 12 degrees warmer than today were 50 million years ago.
At that time, there were no people at all and the whole world looked
_totally_ different from today.
So from that we cannot learn anything about what 2 or 3 degrees warmer
would mean for our modern world with its 8 billion people.
For all we know, 3 degrees warmer would be a _huge_ problem.

The most important factor here is time.
If a climate change takes several thousand years to unfold,
humankind can adapt to it gradually over a long time.
For instance in the current geological era temperature changes similar
to the once we are currently facing have occured many times,
but that was in cycles of 41,000 or 100,000 years.
The current, man-made half-cycle would be about half as large
in terms of temperature, but given its length of about 100 years
would be a hundred times faster.
That is what makes the current situation so uniquely dangerous.

### But can't we solve this much more cheaply with new technology?

Indeed, if the current rate of technical progress we have seen in the
last 200 years continues for another 200 years, covering our
energy needs without burning coal, oil, or gas will be a piece of cake.

Unfortunately, that is not a solution, because:
1. We cannot wait 200 years.
   If we do not act now, the conflicts arising from climate change
   may soon be so strong that they might rip apart our current civilisation.
2. From a purely technical point of view, we could already
   make enough energy with _current_ solar technology without using any
   coal, oil, or gas.
   A small fraction of the world's desert areas would be sufficient.
   Alas, the amount of financial capital needed to do make this happen and the
   geopolitical risks involved are very high;
   see for instance the failed Desertec project.
   We need to smooth the transition into a CO2-neutral future
   by attaching a price to CO2 emission.
3. Any CO2 emission produces a temperature increase for about
   a decade before the earth system reaches a new temperature equilibrium.
   CO2 stays in the atmosphere (and has a greenhouse effect)
   for several centuries.
   So any technical progress will not have its full effect immediately,
   which is another reason why we must currently use all available methods
   to limit global warming.
